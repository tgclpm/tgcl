                            Investors have been made wary of web 3 investments through token form as the value of the
                            freely floating digital assets are hard to control and turn into high-risk speculative
                            instruments quickly. By tokenizing equity, we are ensuring that the investment has intrinsic
                            value that can be well defined by the projectâ€™s operational success while keeping the
                            investment liquid and freely tradeable between investors.
