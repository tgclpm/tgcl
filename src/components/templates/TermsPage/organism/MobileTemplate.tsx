                                    price determined by the Startup themselves.

                                    Startups are early-stage venture companies, and for this reason purchasing of the
                                    Tokens involves a high degree of risk and many or most venture company investments
                                    lose money and fail at a particularly high rate. You may ultimately get a profit and

                                    Each Startup is expected to have limited or no operational record. Moreover, due to
